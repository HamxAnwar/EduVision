# Project: EduVision - An AI-Powered Interactive Learning Platform
## Core Focus for Starting:

### Interactive Learning Chatbot (LLM)
- A chatbot for answering questions and providing explanations for school/college-level subjects in Urdu and English.
- Example: "Explain Newtonâ€™s Laws of Motion" or "What is the capital of Balochistan?"
- Content will be curated for the local syllabus (e.g., Matric, FSC).

### Visual Learning Module (VLM)
- An image-based Q&A system for educational content.
- Example: Upload a diagram of the human body and ask, "What is this organ?"
- Focus on supporting science and geography topics initially.

### AI-Powered Quiz System (CV)
- A camera-based system to scan handwritten answers and grade simple quizzes.
- Start with MCQs and short answers for school students.

## Technical Stack:
- LLMs: OpenAI GPT models or locally hosted LLMs for language tasks.
- VLMs: CLIP or similar models for vision-language tasks.
- CV: TensorFlow, PyTorch, or OpenCV for real-time engagement analysis and object recognition.

## Impact:
- Educational Institutions: Empower teachers and students with AI-enhanced resources.
- Companies: Upskill employees for local industries like mining and agriculture.
- Community: Promote tech adoption in underserved areas of Balochistan.
